## Normalization and Denormalization:
In a database, alteration of data can be categorized into two types.  
- Normalization
- Denormalization

Let's see normalization and denormalization along the differences between them,  

| Normalization                                              | v/s        | Denormalization                                              |
|:----------------------------------------------------------:|:----------:|:------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Normalization means removal of redundant and inconsistent  | whereas    | Denormalization means combining multiple data table into one |
  data and storing only non-redundant data into the database.               so that it can be queried quickly.
